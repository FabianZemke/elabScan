# elabScan
This project is intended to provide a software for creating sampleIDs, which can be printed as QR code, saved as a PNG or uploaded into the electronic laboratory notebook "elabFTW". The program was originally programmed under the name "CeramScan" at the Chair of Advanced Ceramic Materials at the Technische Universit√§t Berlin. It will be adapted soon(TM) to be under the name elabScan.

## Installation

Under construction

### Config.txt

Make sure to create a file in your main directory called "config.txt" or rename the "config_example.txt".

It should be in the format of:

```
API_Key = XYZ
Category_ID = 1
ElabFTW_URL = https://xyz/api/v2/
Institution = YOUR INSTITUTE
StartingYear = 2011
Standard Output folder = 
LinkID = https://xyz
```

* API Key is the key you can create with elabFTW. It should have Read/Write access.
* Category ID is the id of the database/resource element that you create. E.g., the sampleID database element that you created before.
* ElabFTW URL is the link to your elabftw installation.
* Institution is the name of your workplace.
* Starting year is the year from which the CeramScan program counts upwards.
* Link ID is the link to your excel table which has the first, last names and their abbreviation present. Currently it reaches a tubcloud Excel file with a worksheet called "userid".
